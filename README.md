# ClimateCheck
 [ClimateCheck](https://climatecheckprj.netlify.app) is a site to check various graphs about Climate change.
 It uses the APIs from [Global Warming API ](https://global-warming.org)
 
There are 5 pages(one still not working beacouse the api is not aviable)

You just need to click one of the buttons on the cards and BOOM!

A graph

How does it work?

First we make the api call, and fix some data to make the graph lighter becouse the amount of data may cause lag on the page
![{57EEA6AC-3A64-4440-8C7E-BAB525E880FD}](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bec4e4c-39d8-4db5-825a-f81d9ce322e6)

Once we have our data we put it on the graph using the graphic library chart.js

Then we create the link for the various using react-router-dom

We create the cards using a switch and a template for the cards
